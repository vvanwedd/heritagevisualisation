Heritage Scanning Methods
*************************
Plenty of methods exist to capture our heritage artefacts. 
A method's type of output, its benefits and shortcomings are very much technology dependent. Understanding and carefully documenting which method was used, will help to valiorize scientific research results. See also the `Digital Lab Notebook <http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/Digital_Lab_Notebook/index.html>`_ initiative.
For :ref:`singlecameramultilight:Single-Camera, Multi-Light Technology`, the main focus of this website, we've tried to provide the necessary reading material to appreciate this form of heritage capture. We've also provided a web viewer for these kinds of files and proposed a novel open source file type, based on popular existing file types, to make sure these kinds of recordings can be consulted in the future.

What is next is an overview of heritage scanning methods.
