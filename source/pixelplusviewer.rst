pixel+ Viewer
===================================

The pixel+ viewer is an open source tool to visually analyse the surface of artifacts. It provides a realistic view of the interaction between material and light. It goes beyond traditional photography as it allows the user to virtually interact with the surface of the object by manipulating the light and enhance specific characteristics of the surface. 

The unique features of the viewer are that it supports various interactive single-camera multi-light `file formats <http://www.heritage-visualisation.org/gltf.html>`_ (CUN, ZUN, PTM, RTI or glTF) and combines the predefined simulations from both the PLD and RTI platforms within one interface.

**How to cite the pixel+ viewer:**

If you are using the pixel+ viewer or results from the pixel+ viewer in one of your research articles or otherwise want to refer to it, please use the following format:

  Vanweddingen V., Proesmans, M., Hameeuw, H., Vandermeulen, B., Van der Perre, A., Vastenhoud C., Lemmers F., Watteeuw. L., Van Gool L.  (2020). Pixel+ viewer, available from http://www.heritage-visualisation.org


Look at the :ref:`examples:Examples` for a brief glimpse of what can be seen with these kinds of recordings. Note that deep links to open these examples directly in the viewer have been made available as well.

To fully appreciate what the pixel+ viewer can reveal, it is paramount to understand the various :ref:`visualstyles:Visual styles`.

For an overview of the 3D scanning technologies making these kinds of recordings possible, ie. RTI, PLD, PTM, look at the :ref:`singlecameramultilight:Single-Camera, Multi-Light Technology` page.

Finally, on the :ref:`backgroundmaterial:Background material` page, you can read about topics like color, multispectral imaging and long term preservation.
