pixel+ viewer
===================================

The pixel+ viewer is a WebGL based viewer for single camera, multi light recordings. Go directly to `the viewer <http://www.heritage-visualisation.org/viewer/viewer.php>`_ 

Look at the :ref:`examples:Examples` for a brief glimpse of what can be seen with these kinds of recordings. Note that deep links to open these examples directly in the viewer have been made available as well.

To fully appreciate what the pixel+ viewer can reveal, it is paramount to understand the various :ref:`visualstyles:Visual styles`.

For an overview of the 3D scanning technologies making these kinds of recordings possible, ie. RTI, PLD, PTM, look at the :ref:`technologies:Technologies`.

Finally, on the :ref:`backgroundmaterial:Background material` page, you can read about topics like color, multispectral imaging and long term preservation.
