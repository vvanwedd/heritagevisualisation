===================================

Thanks to technological advancements heritage scholars have nowadays a plethora of tools available to examine cultural heritage artefacts. 

This website tries to provide an overview of these :ref:`technologies:Heritage Scanning Methods` and focusses on one particular type, i.e. :ref:`singlecameramultilight:Single-Camera, Multi-Light Technology`.

The pixel+ viewer is a WebGL based viewer for single camera, multi light recordings, i.e. PLD, RTI, PTM recordings. Go directly to `the viewer <http://www.heritage-visualisation.org/viewer/viewer.php>`_ 

Look at the :ref:`examples:Examples` for a brief glimpse of what can be seen with these kinds of recordings. Note that deep links to open these examples directly in the viewer have been made available as well.

To fully appreciate what the pixel+ viewer can reveal, it is paramount to understand the various :ref:`visualstyles:Visual Styles`.

Learn more about the :ref:`pixelplus:pixel+ Project`, of which this website and the pixel+ viewer are the major outcomes.

Finally, on the :ref:`backgroundmaterial:Background Material` page, you can read about topics like color, multispectral imaging and long term preservation.
