   BRDF
     A Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is a mathematical description of how light interacts with matter. As such it defines the material appearance and is often the key to photorealistic rendering, more so than highly detailed 3D geometry. With SCML imaging, a subset of a BRDF can be extracted, which can be used in a (realistic) relighting visual style to classify materials based on their appearance.
     Examples of analytical BRDFs include: Ashikhmin-Shirley, Blinn, Beard-Maxwell, Cook-Torrance, Hapke/Lommel-Seeliger, He et al., Kaijiya, Lafortune, Lewis, Minnaert, Phong, Poulin-Fournier, Oren-Nayar, Schlick, Strauss, Torrance-Sparrow, Ward, Westin.
