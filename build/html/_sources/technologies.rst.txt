Heritage Scanning Methods
*************************
Plenty of methods exist to capture and study our heritage artefacts. Sadly, information about these methods is scattered across the Internet. This page tries to provide a high level overview.

A method's type of output, its benefits and shortcomings are very much technology dependent. Understanding and carefully documenting which method and scanning methodology was used, will help to valiorize scientific research results. See also the `Digital Lab Notebook <http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/Digital_Lab_Notebook/index.html>`_ initiative.
For :ref:`singlecameramultilight:Single-Camera, Multi-Light Technology`, the main focus of this website, we've tried to provide the necessary reading material to appreciate this form of heritage capture. We've also provided a web viewer for these kinds of files and proposed a novel open source file type, based on popular existing file types, to make sure these kinds of recordings can be consulted in the future.

What is next is an overview of heritage scanning methods.


3D Reconstruction Methods
=========================
Plenty of methods exist to reconstruct a 3D representation of cultural artefacts. Depending on the used technology, some methods work better on objects with certain shapes and materials than others. Most of the time, these algorithms have lots of parameters that the user should set to obtain optimal results. Software packages like Agisoft Metashape typically combine several (tweaked) algorithms.
